# TINYML-POWERED-ELECTRONIC-NOSE-FOR-NON-INVASIVE-DIABETES-SCREENING-BASED-ON-BREATHING-ANALYSIS.
This project aims to develop a TinyML-powered electronic nose (E-Nose) for noninvasive diabetes screening based on breath analysis. The system will use a set of gas sensors to detect acetone levels in exhaled breath, which correlate with blood glucose levels.
